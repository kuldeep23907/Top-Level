# _Machu-Picchu_ Project Overview
This document describes an open mutual crop risk-sharing project using blockchain, Earth Observation and Actuarial Risk Modelling. It is based on the same philosophy as IBISA (https://ibisa.network/), but _Machu-Picchu_ is a collaborative project while IBISA is a classical monolithic structure. In _Machu-Picchu_, IBISA would be a simple collaborative participant as any other guests and an external user of _Machu-Picchu_ data. 

As of today, August 2020, _Picchu_ is well progressed: [McGyver, a preview tool of it exists here](https://ibisa.users.earthengine.app/view/mcgyver3). With this tool you can observe the state of vegetation on 60 villages located in Tamil Nadu, India. With [310 farmers](https://github.com/Machu-Pichu/Top-Level/blob/master/20200908%20Localised%20Tamil%20Nadu%20farmers.csv.txt) (August 2020) scattered in 60 villages, each village has in average 5 paying farmers participating to IBISA. In McGyver you can change the month of observation. For that month you can observe the health of vegetation and it's hydric stress. IBISA expects 5000 paying farmers end of 2020 and is pre-registering 10,000 [breeders in Niger](https://github.com/Machu-Pichu/Top-Level/blob/master/20200908%20Localised%20Tamil%20Nadu%20farmers.csv.txt) for 2021.

However _Machu_ doesn't exist yet in blockchain form but a mere prototype was done in 2018. Participants to the ConsenSys Bootcamp 2020 are heartily invited to select which part in _Machu-Picchu_ to use for their Final Project. They can use real life values of farmersz and breeders to do their testing.

The fundamental vision of the _Machu-Picchu_ project is the following:
* today data belong to big platforms
* with these data, these platforms are more powerful than local authorities. They know more about the citizens habits of mobility, of leisure, of consuming, of credit, of social networking etc.
* these data SHOULD BE A **PUBLIC SERVICE**
* the decentralised blockchain 2.0 is an ideal tool to support such a public service.

From this vision, the project aims to build a collaborative open source public service of open data, geared at the protection of crop risks of smallholder farmers worldwide. On such a public service could blossom a full ecosystem of services, like on the data of Uber or Facebook, but not owned by any single entity. 

* This ecosystem would be similar to the ecosystem of roads, on which could prosper transportation services, commerce and repair of vehicle, driving school, hotels, restaurants, shops, guides, maps, directories etc. 
* **Remember how Road 66 gave birth to the complete economy of the West**. The power that fueled the growth of such an ecosystem is the universal need for roads. There has not been one single company that made and owned Road 66.
* The same universal need for crop protection (more than 500M farmers worldwide feeding 90% of the world) will feed the ecosystem built on _Machu-Picchu_.

[Business Model...](https://github.com/Machu-Pichu/Top-Level/blob/master/BusinessModel.md)

The components are (see drawings below, in [Machu-Picchu Description](https://github.com/Machu-Pichu/Top-Level/blob/master/README/0-README.md):

1. [**_Machu_**, aka RSC (Risk-Sharing Community)](https://github.com/kvutien/Top-Level/tree/master/RSC): a distributed blockchain-based risk-sharing community, storing information on farmers, geographical locations of  the plots of field, onboarding date, (group membership, to be confirmed);
2. [**_Picchu_**, aka WCC (Watcher Collaborative Community)](https://github.com/kvutien/Top-Level/tree/master/WCC): a decentralised blockchain-based vegetation loss assessment community (by crowdsourcing), storing information on location of the centre of group, date of (monthly) assessment, watcher assessing, percentage of loss.

The two communities _Machu_ and _Picchu_ are open source. Any watcher can develop and contribute a watching helper tool to the _Picchu_ community. Any enabler can develop its own application to read the _Machu_ blockchain and connect to its own customer database. The enabler is free to record of contributions and the loss compensation calculation using a classical database or using another blockchain.
