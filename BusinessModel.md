# Business Model of _Machu-Picchu_ Project
_Machu-Picchu_ intends to build a public service of data to protect smallholder farmers and breeders worldwide and further improve their lives. [More details here](https://github.com/Machu-Pichu/Top-Level/blob/master/README.md)
* **Public service of data**: data is on a blockchain, is visible and usable by everybody;
* **To protect smallholder farmers worldwide**: the first use of data is to implement a decentralised mutual crop risk-sharing service;
* **To further improve**: the same data can be used to do credit rating of farmers, to feed incentive programs for education, for gender equality, and to server statistics to support other programs of authorities and international bodies.

The ambition of _Machu-Picchu_ is to become a public service serving a similar purpose as today's platform like Uber, FaceBook, Google etc. but instead of being proprietary the data would serve the public benefit and feed the global socio-economic substrate.
* Today these platforms are more powerful with their data than any local authority. They know more about the habits of the citizens: mobility, consuming, socialising etc.
* At a certain scale of _Machu-Picchu_, like [Road 66](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._Route_66) and other road networks in the world, this public service of data of smallholder farmers brings a public social economic **return on investment of several orders of magnitude**.

## The business model of _Machu-Picchu_
The business model of _Machu-Picchu_ is similar to a public service such as a road network: a main road and a lot of feeder roads. The component roads of whole network are built by a lot of independent entities and the value of the whole is more than each component separately.
### The complementarity _Machu-Picchu_ & IBISA
Contrary to the rich market in developed countries that fueled the growth of AirBnB, Uber and the like, the smallholder market of IBISA needs to reach a large size before the revenues can sustain a powerful development team. In the meantime, _Machu-Picchu_ brings to IBISA this technical development force (_pro-bono_ and open source) that reinforces the credibility of IBISA with investors.

On the other side, IBISA is collecting a rich real life thesaurus of data (thousands of [members currently in India](https://github.com/Machu-Pichu/Top-Level/blob/master/20200908%20Localised%20Tamil%20Nadu%20farmers.csv.txt) and [the same in Niger)](https://github.com/Machu-Pichu/Top-Level/blob/master/20200908%20Localised%20Niger%20Breeders.csv.txt) that _Machu-Picchu_ will use to validate its developments.
### Sources of benefits
The immediate benefit of _Machu-Picchu_ is to lower the risk-sharing costs. As a result, economic activity will be changed throughout the whole economy as the saved resources are re-deployed, as smallholder farmers and breeders adjust to their new cost and pattern of expenditure. 

The extent to which the local economy will benefit from the investment will be dependent on its economic potential, such as unused land and labour, and on the magnitude of the change in economic practices, cascading up from agriculture to the services (education, health, legal etc.). The effect on the economy is extremely complex and is virtually impossible to model in detail.
### Immediate Benefits (RoI x10-x1000)
* Better Protection
* Less Modern Slavery
* Better Agricultural Practices
### Second Order Benefits (RoI x1000-x100'000)
* Growth of Micro-Finance Appetite & Profitability
* More stable food supply
* Better Education
* More Gender Equality
### Third Order Benefits (RoI x100'000-x10'000'000)
* Better use of transport
* More social interactivity
* Economic growth
## The business model of _Machu-Picchu_ developers
* Early bird on technology aspects of a global service (compliance, security, interface with legacy)
* Early bird on business process impacted by modern toold (software engineering, training, communication)
* Early bird on use of data for international institutions (advisory, expertise, PoC)
* Multifactorial use of modern tools on feeder services for public usages (blockchain, blockchain "oracle", Earth Observation, virtual currency, mobile money, reputation tokens, crowdsourcing, decentralised trust etc.)
