# Business Model of Machu-Picchu Project
_Machu-Picchu_ intends to build a public service of data to protect smallholder farmers worldwide and further improve their lives.
* Public service of data: data is on a blockchain, is visible and usable by everybody;
* To protect smallholder farmers worldwide: the first use of data is to implement a decentralised mutual risk sharing service;
* To further improve: the same data can be used to do credit rating of farmers, to feed incentive programs for education, for gender equality, and to server statistics to support other programs of authorities and international bodies.

The ambition of _Machu-Picchu_ is to become a public service serving a similar purpose as today's platform like Uber, FaceBook, Google etc.
* These platforms are more powerful with their data than any local authority. They know more about the habits of the citizens: mobility, consuming, socialising etc.
* At a certain scale of _Machu-Picchu_, like [Road 66](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._Route_66) and other road networks in the world, the public service of data on smallholder farmers can feed a considerable ecosystme of services for the public benefit.

## The context
* Smallholder farmers feed 90% of the world [IFAD report 2013](https://www.ifad.org/documents/38714170/40706188/Smallholders+can+feed+the+world_e.pdf);
* Their revenues are not well protected against calamities: the risks are too small and happen too frequently for the classical insurance to be profitable and viable;
* They practiced for millenaries risk-sharing among them at village level, but this is not enough with Climate Change;
* IBISA uses the blockchain to model the same decentralised mutual approach and scale it globally. At the same time, IBISA uses Earth Observation to do damage assessment at a lowest cost possible and leave as much money as possible to the protection mission itself. However, to prove its revolutionary approach IBISA needs to be immediately visible and implemented its solution in a centralised architecture.
* Machu-Picchu is a long-term work to bring the same idea as IBISA to reality. In final, _Machu-Picchu_'s public data would serve IBISA as any other user of the public data and IBISA would contribute to the ecosystem as any other contributor.

## The business model of _Machu-Picchu_
The business model of Â¨Machu-Picchu_ is similar to a public service such as a road network: a main road and a lot of feeder roads. The component roads of whole network are built by a lot of independent entities and the value of the whole is more than each component separately.
