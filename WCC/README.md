# The Watcher Collaborative Community

The Watcher Collaborative Community (WCC) takes advantage of the 21st century Earth Observation services such as _Google Earth Engine_ (Google) and Sentinel _EO-browser_ (Sinergise), that are made available at no cost to the public for non-commercial uses. 

Such services use cloud computing, cloud storage and parallel computing to take care of the Earth Observation computing chores such as filtering individual satellite images by location and by date, compositing them into larger images, managing resolution scales, applying image processing algorithms, calculating statistics on pixels, managing the display etc.

Such free and easy-to-use services makes it possible to crowdsource photo-interpretation that used to be reserved to highly skilled specialists. In turn, low cost crowdsourcing opens the possibility of "TechForGood", using technology for humanitary purposes such as assessing by satellite crop losses in a transparent and neutral way, helping smallholder farmers to share their risks.

Most crowdsourcing initiatives have been managed in a centralised way, with an authority that dispatches the work, collects the contributions, validates them, consolidates the results before making them available to the public. The WCC initiative leverages the blockchain technology to decentralise these tasks to achieve totally autonomous operations.
