# WCC Earth Observation scripts
All EO scripts of ECC at the date of July 2020 are for Google Earth Engine and are in the Git repository of GEE. Since the GEE repository is not meant for documentation, the descriptions of the scripts are moved here. For the most up to date source code, refer to the GEE repository.
