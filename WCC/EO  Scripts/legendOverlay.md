# The GEE script `legendOverlay`that creates a scale of colours as legend on the Map
This function is taken from the blog `Open Geo Blog: https://mygeoblog.com/2016/12/09/add-a-legend-to-to-your-gee-map/)`.
It draws a vertical scale of colours that is a gradual change between `min` and `max` of the colour palette given as argument in `visuAnoNDVI`, based on the underlying equivalent latitudes of the matching point the map on which the scale is drawn.
