# User Story - "Enabler" (Contribution) dApp
## Long-Term "Enabler" User Story
This dApp is a catch-all dApp: it covers both the roles of an "Enabler", typically an NGO who helps the famers, and supervision authority, who wants only an Account Explorer to make sure that the risk-sharing process works as advertised. An Enabler in _Machu-Picchu_ is any entity that interacts with the Mem√πbers to help them. It can be an NGO, a cooperative, a government development agency, a vendor of inputs (seeds, fertizers) or an international food company who buys the crop. Most often, the Enabler has its own ERM (Enterprise Resource Management) software. The latter can be centralised or can be itself based on the blockchain.

The dApp has at minimum a calculation of the damage compensation to be transferred to each farmer

The Enabler owns this personal data in the sense of GDPR's "data controller". The Enabler can invalidate all or part of it or rewrite it. If a service (like health, education, gender equality, child protection, good agricultural practices etc.) needs a data, it may ask the Member to add the information in this set of personal data.
