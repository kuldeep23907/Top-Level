# Hackathon's overall User Story and Architecture
_Machu-Picchu_ models the existing manual risk-sharing practices among rural communities, but uses the blockchain and Earth Observation to scale globally. The approach is pragmatic, as done by field actors today: whatever is technically feasible and compatible with regulations is implemented, the rest is done manually. Therefore we need to make the distinction between the long-term (final?) User Story and the hackathon's User Story.
## Long term User Story
The long-term User Story is described in the [README of the Top-level Machu-Picchu](https://github.com/kvutien/Machu_Picchu_Top-Level/blob/master/README.md)
## Hackathon's User Story
The hackathon team will implement 3 dApps:
* contribution, used by the farmer or by the "enabler" (the NGO who supports the farmer) on behalf of the farmer
* damage assessment, used by the "watcher". This dApp is supported by an Earth Observation app, already developed outside the Hackathon
* compensation and account explorer, used by the "enabler" and by the supervision authority

The hackathon will use a single private blockchain; In the future, each dApp will use a distinct blockchain. The different blockchains will interoperate via Cosmos, or PolkaDot, or equivalent.
