# Hackathon's overall User Story and Architecture
_Machu-Picchu_ models the existing manual risk-sharing practices among rural communities, using the blockcgain and Earth Observation to scale. The approach is pragmatic, as done by field actors today: whatever is technically feasible and compatible with regulations is implemented, the rest is done manually. Therefore we need to make the distinction between the long-term (final?) User Story.
## Long term User Story
The long-term User Story is described in the [README of the Top-level Machu-Picchu](https://github.com/kvutien/Machu_Picchu_Top-Level/blob/master/README.md)
