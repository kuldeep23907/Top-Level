This sub-repo stores the project _Machu-Picchu_ limited to the hackathon "ETHOnline 2020".
## Work Plan
Here is the work plan I'd propose for the ETHOnline hackathon:
* _Principle_: use the blockchain to make a distributed crop risk sharing tool, that answers the need of more than 500M farmers worldwide, need that is not satisfied until now;
* _Use Earth Observation and blockchain_ to reduce drastically the costs, which existing insurance could not do for the past 40 years;
* _Reuse my EO web app_ using Earth Observation data, McGyver (https://ibisa.users.earthengine.app/view/mcgyver3);
* _Model the whole workflow_ of farmers contributing to the decentralised pot, watchers assessing the loss, calculation of the compensation, plus an account explorer;
* _Always have something that can be shown_ at the end of every week.

## Organisation
* _week 0_: I'm already hacking the special Earth Observation McGyver for the hackathon, with 4 farmers only; organise the github sub-repo inside Machu-Picchu; prepare the presentation video. i'm beta tester of mmhmm (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8KhKBLoSMk);
* _week 1_: we hack a simplistic dApp, composed of the complete workflow. We deploy already the backend on a testnet and the frontend on IPFS [(see here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADoRVVOSpI8)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADoRVVOSpI8) to get ready;
* _week 2 and 3_: split the dApp into 4 dApps; each of us will be primary developer on one dApp and backup on another; we progress, we sync and integrate every weekend, we keep the result on testnet and IPFS (I volunteer for that...);
* _week 4_: no more development, we fine-tune the presentation video and we debug.

After the hackathon, of if we go fast enough in the hackathon, we could also
* change the ETH by a ERC-20 fingible token to represent the contributions and the pay-outs;
* replace the farmers by "groups" of farmers, which is closer to the actual process. The fields of groups are assessed as a whole, which avoids the "moral hazard" where someone becomes sloppy because the solidarity will cover their bad practices;
* start using IPFS to store voluminous and slow changing data
