## Long-Term "Watcher" User Story
A Watcher in _Machu-Picchu_ is anyone who participates to the crowdsourced assessment of the vegetation health of a location. In Tamil Nadu, the area to be assessed is 2 km wide. In Niger, the area is 5 km wide. The "reputation" of a watcher depends on the long-tem accuracy and on the regularity of the job done. Maintaining the reputation without any central authority is a topic for DeFi (Decentralised Finance).

A Watcher needs to stake a certain amount of tokens in order to perform a loss assessment on a location. The closer (resp. farther) is the assessment to the result of the whole community, the higher the reputation tokens earned (resp. lost)

Like the Member, the Watcher owns this personal data in the sense of GDPR's "data controller". The Watcher can invalidate all or part of it or rewrite it.

### Data Model
In the Long-term, a Watcher is represented by the following personal data:
* number of reputation token owned
* number of reputation tokens staked for the month

For each assessment the following data is kept for a Watcher
* Month of assessment
* GPS coordinates of a location
* Percentage of damage as assessed by the Watcher
* Number of staked reputation tokens for this location
* Percentage of damage as assessed by the whole community
