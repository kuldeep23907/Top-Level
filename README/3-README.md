# One last thing
The idea of IBISA and the identification of its feasibility was originated by [Mar√≠a Mateo Iborra](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mariamateoiborra/) and initalised by a Kickstarter [project funded by the European Space Agency](https://business.esa.int/projects/ibisa-1).

Machu-Picchu is the name of the legendary ["lost city of the Inca"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machu_Picchu). It was lost but it was finally discovered. Hope the same for our _Machu-Picchu_. Mutual crop protection existed for centuries within villages, we are rediscovering it and scaling it up globally with the blockchain, with satellite data and actuarial calculation, tools of the 21st century.
