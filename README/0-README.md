# _Machu-Picchu_ Project Description
The components are: ![Overall RSC-WCC Architecture](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kvutien/Top-Level/master/common/images/20200717%20RSC-WCC%20Overall%20Architecture.png)

1. [**_Machu_**, aka RSC (Risk-Sharing Community)](https://github.com/kvutien/Top-Level/tree/master/RSC): a blockchain-based risk-sharing community, storing information on farmers, geographical locations of  the plots of field, onboarding date, (group membership, to be confirmed);
2. [**_Picchu_**, aka WCC (Watcher Collaborative Community)](https://github.com/kvutien/Top-Level/tree/master/WCC): a blockchain-based vegetation loss assessment community, storing information on location of the centre of group, date of (monthly) assessment, watcher assessing, percentage of loss.

The 2 blockchains are interoperable via Cosmos or PolkaDot. In the future, other loss assessment blockchains can join the community and their data may be used by other risk-sharing communities. The name _Machu-Picchu_ itself summarizes the nature of the project: _Machu_ wouldn't exist without _Picchu_, and _Picchu_ wouldn't make sense without _Machu_.

The two communities _Machu_ and _Picchu_ are open source. Any watcher can develop and contribute a watching helper tool to the _Picchu_ community. Any enabler can develop its own application to read the _Machu_ blockchain and connect to its own customer database. The enabler is free to record of contributions and the loss compensation calculation using a classical database or using another blockchain.

As of today, August 2020, _Machu_ doesn't exist yet in blockchain form but [McGyver, a preview tool of _Picchu_ exists here](https://ibisa.users.earthengine.app/view/mcgyver3). With this tool you can observe the state of vegetation on 60 villages located in Tamil Nadu, India. With 310 farmers (August 2020) scattered in 60 villages, each village has in average 5 paying farmers participating to IBISA. In McGyver you can change the month of observation. For that month you can observe the health of vegetation and it's hydric stress. IBISA expects 5000 paying farmers end of 2020 and is pre-registering 10,000 breeders in Niger for 2021.
