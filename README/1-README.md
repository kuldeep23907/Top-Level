# What is the pain? what is the solution?
The need and the opportunities are huge since there are more than 500 M smallholder farmers who don't have access to crop insurance while providing 90% of the world's food. See [IFAD report 2013](https://www.ifad.org/documents/38714170/40706188/Smallholders+can+feed+the+world_e.pdf/460ca6c2-7621-40d8-9f79-a56f6f8fa75e). The situation has worsened since 2013. But today in 2021 the planets are aligned to create a cost-effective solution:
* Smallholder farmers communities need to share risks. **_They have done so for centuries_**, at village level;
* With the Climate Change, the risk protection must be extended to a much larger scale, typically using insurance. Unfortunately, existing insurances have too high operations costs because they use business process practices of the 19th century, although digitalized for the 21st century. The brokering part is being handled by mobile technologies, but it covers only a minor part of the high administrative costs;
* To lower assessment costs, insurers started using parametric approaches using Earth Observation data, but the existing algorithms are either multi-factorial and expensive or use a single factor and give disappointing results on the field;
* Earth Observation data is available for free, Google Earth Engine is available for free research and non-commercial uses and the layperson can have access to powerful and easy-to-use tools;
* Blockchain-based libraries exist in open source to support reputation-based crowdsourcing and record risk-sharing loss.

The solution proposed by IBISA (_Inclusive Blockchain Insurance using Space Assets_) is to use the blockchain to share the risks and use human collective intelligence (crowd-watching) instead of machine algorithms to assess crop damages. This approach reduces drastically the costs, with a potentially equal accuracy. However, because the landscape it starts from was empty, IBISA had to implement the whole value chain to convince existing actors, resulting in an immediately usable but monolithic architecture.
